%   [x,y,z] = R2xyz(R_AB) 
%   3 angles x,y,z about new axes (intrinsic) in the order x-y-z are found
%   from the rotation matrix R_AB. The angles (called Euler angles or
%   Taitâ€“Bryan angles) are defined by the following procedure of successive
%   rotations:
%   Given two arbitrary coordinate frames A and B. Consider a temporary frame
%   T that initially coincides with A. In order to make T align with B, we
%   first rotate T an angle x about its x-axis (common axis for both A and T).
%   Secondly, T is rotated an angle y about the NEW y-axis of T. Finally, T
%   is rotated an angle z about its NEWEST z-axis. The final orientation of
%   T now coincides with the orientation of B.
%
%   The signs of the angles are given by the directions of the axes and the
%   right hand rule.
%
%   IN:
%   R_AB  [no unit]	3x3 rotation matrix (direction cosine matrix) such that the
%                   relation between a vector v decomposed in A and B is
%                   given by: v_A = R_AB * v_B
%
%   OUT:
%   x,y,z [rad]	    Angles of rotation about new axes.

    % Lower left 2x2 elements of R_AB now only consists of sin_z and cos_z.
    % Using the two whose signs are the same for both singularities:
